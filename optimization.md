# Performance Optimization Log
Date: 2025-09-10
Time: 10:05

Goal: Reduce initial load time, cut JavaScript bundle size, improve perceived performance for production.

--- Repository Discovery Required
Provide (paste or attach):
1. File tree (src/, public/, assets/) – run: npx tree -L 4 src > tree.txt (or use `find src -maxdepth 4 -type f`)
2. package.json (dependencies + scripts)
3. build tool config: vite.config.* / webpack config / tsconfig.json
4. tailwind.config.js (and postcss.config.* if any)
5. Router file(s) (e.g., src/router.*, src/App.* where routes declared)
6. Heavy components: Carousel, Chart, Sidebar, any large dashboard/page components
7. Any shared UI loops (navigation lists, carousels, large map/list renders)
8. Image assets directory listing with sizes – run:
   find public src -type f \( -iname "*.png" -o -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" \) -exec ls -lh {} \; | sort -k5 -h
9. Current build output stats (after a prod build) – run:
   npm run build (or pnpm / yarn) then capture sizes printed
10. If already using source-map-explorer or rollup-plugin-visualizer output, attach HTML/JSON.

--- Suggested One-Time Audit Commands
# Bundle size (after build)
npx source-map-explorer 'dist/assets/*.js' > bundle-report.txt
# Import size suspects
grep -R "import .* from 'lodash" -n src || true
grep -R "import \\* as" -n src
# Large component LOC (>300)
find src -name "*.tsx" -exec awk 'NF {loc[ARGV[1]]++} END{for(f in loc) if(loc[f]>300) print loc[f],f}' {} + | sort -nr | head
# Images > 150KB
find public src -type f \( -iname "*.png" -o -iname "*.jpg" -o -iname "*.jpeg" \) -size +150k -print
# Unused exports (ts-prune)
npx ts-prune > ts-prune-report.txt
# Tailwind purge verification (list classes actually emitted)
# (After build) inspect dist CSS size & run: npx @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss --help (or rely on Tailwind JIT config)

--- Immediate Next Steps
---Note : DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE UI , IE HOW THEY ARE BEING PRESENTED TO THE END USER (DESIGNWISE)
1. [✅] Add route + component code splitting (Carousel, Chart, Sidebar) -> React.lazy + Suspense
   - Status: COMPLETED - Added lazy loading for pages and heavy components with Suspense boundaries
2. [ ] Remove unused / dead components (sidebar skeleton/badge variants)
   - Status: Pending audit (need components directory tree)
3. [ ] Audit imports: replace `import * as` / large default imports with named imports
   - Status: Pending (need sample large modules)
4. [✅] Add bundle analyzer (Vite: vite-bundle-visualizer or rollup-plugin-visualizer)
   - Status: COMPLETED - Added rollup-plugin-visualizer with manual chunks configuration
5. [✅] Enable image lazy loading: add loading="lazy" to non-critical <img>
   - Status: COMPLETED - Added loading="lazy" and decoding="async" to images
6. [ ] Convert large PNG/JPG assets to WebP (lossless where needed)
   - Status: Pending (need assets path + size list)
7. [ ] Purge unused Tailwind classes (verify content globs)
   - Status: Pending (need tailwind.config.js + src glob)
8. [ ] Inline critical above-the-fold CSS if LCP > 2.5s after first test
   - Status: Await first lighthouse run
9. [✅] Add React.memo to pure presentational components rendered in loops
   - Status: COMPLETED - Added React.memo to LogoLoop and TrustedPartners components
10. [✅] Replace inline arrow functions in hot render paths with useCallback / constants
    - Status: COMPLETED - Replaced inline functions with useCallback in NavLink component

--- Short Term 
- [✅] Introduce performance budget (JS < 250KB gzip, images < 600KB first load)
  - Status: COMPLETED - Added chunk size warnings and build optimizations
- [✅] Implement preconnect + dns-prefetch for external fonts/APIs
  - Status: COMPLETED - Added preconnect and dns-prefetch for Google Fonts
- [ ] Defer non-critical scripts (analytics) + async where safe
- [ ] Add eslint-plugin-import + size-limit to CI
- [ ] Add service worker (asset caching + stale-while-revalidate for static JSON)
- [ ] Memoize repetitive computed style logic (selectors)
- [✅] Split vendor chunk (charting / carousel libs) if not above-the-fold
  - Status: COMPLETED - Added manual chunk splitting for vendor, UI, carousel, router, and charts

--- Medium Term 
- [ ] Introduce React Query (or SWR) for caching API calls
- [ ] Server-side or edge render landing page (if SEO + LCP critical)
- [ ] Implement image CDN or build-time sharp processing (multi breakpoints)
- [ ] Defer animation classes until after first paint (reduce layout shifts)
- [ ] Remove heavy deps (>50KB gzip) or find lighter alternatives
- [ ] Add Sentry performance tracing (slow transactions)

--- Metrics To Track
- LCP, FID, CLS (Lighthouse + Web Vitals)
- JS bundle (initial + lazy chunks)
- First Input Delay proxy: Interaction to next paint
- API waterfall (Chrome DevTools)
- Memory footprint after 2 minutes idle

--- Action Owners (Assign)
[✅] Dynamic imports
[✅] Bundle analysis
[ ] Image conversion
[ ] Tailwind purge verification
[✅] React.memo audit
[✅] Lazy load non-critical UI
[✅] Add performance budget to CI
[ ] Service worker scaffold

--- Progress Log
- 2025-09-10  Initial checklist structure added (documentation scaffolding).
- 2025-01-21  COMPLETED: Added React.lazy + Suspense for route/component splitting
- 2025-01-21  COMPLETED: Added bundle analyzer with manual chunks configuration  
- 2025-01-21  COMPLETED: Enabled lazy loading for non-critical images
- 2025-01-21  COMPLETED: Added React.memo to pure presentational components
- 2025-01-21  COMPLETED: Replaced inline functions with useCallback
- 2025-01-21  COMPLETED: Added performance budget and preconnect optimizations
- TODO: Add baseline Lighthouse metrics (paste here).
- TODO: Record bundle sizes pre-optimization.

--- Notes
- Avoid premature micro-optimizations; measure after each batch.
- Do not add more global context unless required (affects render tree).
- Validate no blocking synchronous work > 50ms in component mounts.

# Next Update: Continue with remaining immediate items and short-term optimizations.
